# Automating AWS EC2 Instances: A DevOps Journey

## Overview

Welcome to the world of DevOps, where efficient management and automation of cloud resources play a pivotal role. This guide takes you through the journey of creating and connecting AWS EC2 instances, emphasizing automation for increased efficiency.

## Manual Instance Creation and Connection

1. **Console Setup**
   - Manually create an EC2 instance using the AWS Console.
   - Choose an AMI, create a key pair, configure security groups, and launch the instance.

2. **Connecting Manually**
   - Connect instances directly from the local terminal using SSH.
   - Avoid short-lived sessions in the AWS CLI UI for long-term tasks.

3. **Key Pair Challenge**
   - Face and resolve permission issues with the .pem file.
   - Adjust permissions with `chmod 600` for secure logins.

## Stopping and Terminating Instances

- Properly manage instances by stopping temporarily to halt costs without deleting, or terminating to remove them permanently.

## Automation with AWS CLI

- Utilize the power of AWS CLI for automation.
- Tasks like creating EC2 instances become seamless.
  
**Task Challenge:** Create an EC2 instance through AWS CLI and list them. Contribute to the [GitHub repository](#link-to-github-repository) to tackle this hands-on task.

## AWS CloudFormation Templates (CFT)

- Define cloud resources as code with AWS CFT.
- Create, customize, and manage instances with ease.

**Task Challenge:** Create an EC2 instance using a CloudFormation Template. Share your insights in the [GitHub repository](#link-to-github-repository).

## Script Automation with AWS API

- Scripting with Python and BOTO3 for powerful automation.
- Write code to create S3 buckets and execute it.

**Task Challenge:** Join the [GitHub repository](#link-to-github-repository) and contribute your code for creating S3 buckets.
