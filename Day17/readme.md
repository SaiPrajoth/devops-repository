# Jenkins Automation Server

[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is an open-source automation server that facilitates continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). This README provides a basic overview of Jenkins architecture and its key components.

## Jenkins Architecture

### 1. Master Node

- Jenkins has a central controller known as the Master Node.
- The Master Node manages and schedules tasks, stores configuration settings, and oversees the system.

### 2. Slave Nodes

- Jenkins can distribute workload to multiple machines called Slave Nodes or Agents.
- Each Slave Node executes tasks assigned by the Master, allowing parallel execution and scalability.

### 3. Job

- A job in Jenkins represents a task or a set of tasks to be executed.
- Users define and configure jobs through the Jenkins web interface.

### 4. Build Executor

- Each node (Master or Slave) has one or more Build Executors responsible for running individual jobs.
- Build Executors execute the steps defined in the job configuration.

### 5. Workspace

- Every job gets a dedicated workspace on the node where it performs its work.
- The workspace is a directory for storing source code, build artifacts, and other job-related files.

### 6. Plugins

- Jenkins supports a rich ecosystem of plugins extending its functionality.
- Plugins integrate Jenkins with various tools, version control systems, and technologies.

### 7. Web Interface

- Jenkins provides a web-based user interface for configuration and monitoring.
- Users interact with Jenkins through the web interface to create and manage jobs.

### 8. Build Pipeline

- Jenkins allows the creation of build pipelines, chaining multiple jobs together.
- Pipelines define workflows from code integration to deployment.

### 9. Version Control Integration

- Jenkins integrates with version control systems (e.g., Git, SVN) to trigger builds based on code changes.
- Webhooks or polling mechanisms detect changes in the repository.

### 10. Artifact Repositories

- Jenkins can store and manage build artifacts, such as compiled binaries or deployable packages.
- Artifacts can be archived, shared across pipeline stages, or stored in external repositories.

## Getting Started

1. Install Jenkins: Follow the [official installation guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/) to set up Jenkins on your system.

2. Configure Jenkins: Use the web interface to configure Jenkins, create jobs, and install necessary plugins.

3. Create Jobs: Define jobs to automate your build, test, and deployment processes.

4. Explore Plugins: Enhance Jenkins functionality by exploring and installing relevant plugins.

5. Build Pipelines: Set up build pipelines to streamline your CI/CD workflows.
